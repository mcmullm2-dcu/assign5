# FirstDay App
First Day at a new job. First Day in a new role. First Day covering for a colleague.

Maybe this is you and you'd like to get up to speed quickly without constantly bothering the busy people around you.

Or maybe you've been told to take someone new under your wing on top of everything else you need to do.

Either way, this is the app for you. Encapsulate the best practices for your work environment in simple step-by-step procedures. Use them as a handover document, or a quick refresher. And if you see something that could be done better, leave some feedback to help improve your company's procedures!

A picture is worth a thousand words, so embellish each step with a photo. Search or browse for a procedure relavent to your current task, and if you're not sure what you're looking for, scan a QR code near your workstation to go right to the job at hand.
